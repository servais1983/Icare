# ICARUS Security Model

## Threat Landscape Analysis

### Primary Threats
1. **Nation-State Actors**
   - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
   - Zero-day exploits
   - Supply chain attacks

2. **Quantum Computing Threats**
   - Cryptographic key breaking
   - Quantum algorithms for pattern matching

3. **AI-Powered Attacks**
   - Adversarial ML attacks
   - Automated vulnerability discovery
   - Deepfake-based social engineering

## Defense Mechanisms

### Active Defense Systems

#### NeuralTrap Honeypot Network
- **Dynamic Topology Generation**: Creates believable fake network segments
- **Behavioral Learning**: Records attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
- **Automated Deception**: Feeds false information to attackers

#### Quantum Shield
- **Algorithm Suite**: Kyber (KEM), Dilithium (signatures), SPHINCS+ (stateless)
- **Hybrid Mode**: Combines classical and quantum-resistant algorithms
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key refresh every 24 hours

### Passive Defense Systems

#### GhostMesh Cloaking
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: Makes all traffic appear identical
- **Timing Analysis Prevention**: Random packet delays
- **Topology Hiding**: Virtual network overlays

## Zero-Trust Implementation

### Identity Verification
```yaml
Authentication Chain:
  1. Hardware Token (FIDO2)
  2. Biometric Verification
  3. Behavioral Analysis
  4. Context Validation
  5. Continuous Re-authentication
```

### Micro-segmentation
- Per-application isolation
- Dynamic security zones
- Encrypted east-west traffic

## Incident Response

### Automated Response Matrix

| Threat Level | Response Time | Actions |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Critical | <100ms | Isolate, Contain, Neutralize |
| High | <500ms | Block, Alert, Analyze |
| Medium | <1s | Monitor, Log, Report |
| Low | <5s | Track, Learn, Adapt |

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Instant Rollback**: Snapshot-based recovery
2. **Clean Room**: Isolated analysis environment
3. **Forensic Preservation**: Tamper-proof evidence collection

## Compliance & Auditing

### Continuous Compliance Monitoring
- Real-time policy enforcement
- Automated compliance reports
- Immutable audit logs

### Certifications Target
- Common Criteria EAL7+
- FIPS 140-3 Level 4
- NATO COSMIC TOP SECRET
- DO-178C (Aviation)

## Security Development Lifecycle

### Code Security
- Mandatory code signing
- Supply chain verification
- Reproducible builds
- Memory-safe languages (Rust)

### Testing Requirements
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
- Red team exercises (monthly)
- Chaos engineering (weekly)
- Fuzzing (continuous)
